`trimeta` is an 8-bit von Neumann CPU, capable of performing a variety of arithmetic, bitwise, and branching operations across a 256-byte address space. And it's entirely implemented through C++ template metaprogramming using the [`dimeta`](https://github.com/notfoundry/dimeta) type-level logic gate simulation platform.
